Tasks of Bharat Intern 
Certainly! Here are descriptions for the three projects at Bharat Intern :

**1. Personal Portfolio**
*Description:*
This web design structure consists of a Header Section, encouraging personalization with the option to add your name or a logo and a brief introduction. The About Section incorporates your image and a short bio, offering a personal touch. In the Skills Section, you can list your key skills, while the Projects Section provides a dynamic showcase of your work with project titles, descriptions, and images. The Resume Section offers a downloadable PDF resume, and the Contact Section includes your contact details. The Footer serves as a conclusion with a copyright notice and additional links, providing a well-organized and engaging online portfolio.

**2. Temperature Converter**
*Description:*
The functioning of the temperature converter is straightforward and relies on a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The web application provides a user interface where you can input a temperature in degrees Celsius. As you enter a value, the "oninput" attribute triggers a JavaScript function. Inside this function, the input temperature is obtained and validated to ensure it is a valid number. If valid, the temperature is then converted from Celsius to Fahrenheit using the formula (Celsius * 9/5) + 32. The resulting Fahrenheit temperature is displayed on the web page in real-time, providing an instant conversion. This seamless interplay between the three technologies—HTML for structuring the page, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for handling the conversion—enables users to quickly and accurately convert temperatures between these two common scales, enhancing their understanding and practical use of temperature measurements.

By sharing these three projects on my GitHub profile, I aim to showcase my progress and skills as a Bharat Intern and make my work accessible to potential employers and collaborators. These projects represent my commitment to continuous learning and development in the field of web development.
